# ðŸš‡ Elevator Simulation â€“ Setup Guide

This repository contains the source code for the Elevator Simulation project.  
Follow the steps below to set up and run the project locally.

---

## ðŸ“¦ Prerequisites

- Node.js **>= 18**
- npm or yarn

---

## ðŸš€ Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone repositories
Frontend: git clone https://github.com/SahO-ux/elevator-system-frontend.git
Backend: git clone https://github.com/SahO-ux/elevator-system-backend.git

### 2. Install dependencies:
Install dependencies in both frontend an backend by using command:
- npm install

### 3. Configure environment variables:
In FE, create a .env file in root folder, with following single URL for api calls:-
VITE_REACT_APP_API_URL: http://localhost:8081

In BE, createa .env file in root folder, with following:-
PORT:8081

### 4. Run dev server:
Use the following command in both repos terminal for running the project:-
npm run dev

### You will now be able to see the UI having:
- Controls (Start, Stop, Reset simulation)
- Manual Request (From & To fields)
- Simulation Config for setting up number of elevators and floors
- Scenario simulation buttons which are "Morning Burst" and "Random Burst"
- Live Metrics which polls Served, Avg. Wait(s), Max Wait(s), Pending and Avg. Travel(s) every 2 seconds from endpoint "/api/metrics"
- On right of all this, there will be a Building having 12 floors (default), each floor have Up/Down button.

### If simulation is inactive (initial state), that is start has not been clicked, then even if we try to click on rest of the buttons like Morning Rush, Random Burst, try to create manual request, etc. it will show an error message stating that simulation has to be in active state which is we should click start in order to start simulation

- After starting simulation, you will see a text change on top banner from "Simulation is inactive..." to "Simulation is active".
- You can now use all of the functionalities like adding a manual request by setting up values in from (pickup floor) and to (destination floor) fields which will simulate movement of the lifts.
  
- You can use Morning Rush, which generates 50 random requests from the lobby floor (ground floor or in our case Floor 1) and destination floor will always will different than the lobby floor.
- You can use Random Burst, which generates 100 random requests having both random pickup and destination floors, where destination floor is not equal to pickup floor.
  
- If you want to change number of total floors in a building or number of lifts, you have to stop simulation by using "Stop" button, and then under Simulation Config, you can input values for Elevators and Floors and then click on "Apply Config", and then click "Start" to start simulation and then again you can perform the actions which are mentioned above.

- In Building View, you can see "Call" button at each floor, using which you can send a request to call a lift, simply click on it and enter dstination number in prompt (due to time constraint, havent' used any external lib for modals).
- Inside each lift, you can see a small select box, using which passenger can select the floor, he wants to go after hitting "Send" button beside it

- In Live Metrics section, you can view metrics like Served requests in "Served", Avg. Wait(s), Max. Wait(s), Pending (pending requests) and Avg. Travel(s) using all generated requests (be it from Manual, Morning Rush, Random Burst, etc) which were generated in simulation session, which is when the backend server was started.
